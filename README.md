This app is a prototype containing the following: Spring Boot, Undertow, Angular 1.3, forms authentication with JDBC/MySQL. It requires MySQL's Sakila database with two new tables, user and user_roles, which the schema can be obtained from the basic JPA/JDBC default schema.

It is a starting point, not a finished project. It comes from the "Single" project, https://github.com/dsyer/spring-security-angular/tree/master/single.
